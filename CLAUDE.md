# Claude Code Development Workflow

This document outlines the complete development workflow for Claude Code when working with this chat application project.

## Overview

The development workflow integrates:
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Issue tracking and PR management
- **Git Worktrees**: Isolated feature development with `jeevanpillay/<feature_name>` branches
- **Local Development**: Build validation and linting before commits
- **Vercel CLI**: Deployment monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Turborepo**: Optimized monorepo builds with intelligent caching
- **Bun**: Lightning-fast JavaScript runtime and package manager

## End-to-End Feature Development Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation & Planning

#### Using Issue Templates
The repository provides three Claude Code-optimized issue templates:

1. **Feature Request** - For new features and enhancements
   ```bash
   # When creating a feature request:
   # 1. Use clear "What needs to be done?" language
   # 2. Include file references like @src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx
   # 3. Define browser-testable success criteria
   # 4. Add technical hints for faster implementation
   ```

2. **Bug Report** - For browser-specific issues
   ```bash
   # When reporting bugs:
   # 1. Describe what's broken in the browser
   # 2. Reference specific components with @-mentions
   # 3. Include console errors if any
   # 4. List browsers where issue was verified
   ```

3. **Quick Task** - For simple, straightforward tasks
   ```bash
   # For quick tasks:
   # 1. Brief task description
   # 2. File location (can use @src/path/to/file.tsx)
   # 3. How to test in browser
   ```

#### File References in Issues
Use @ symbol to reference files directly:
- `@src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx` - Specific component files
- `@convex/messages.ts` - Backend files
- `@package.json` - Configuration files
- `@CLAUDE.md` - Documentation

This helps Claude Code navigate directly to relevant files when picking up an issue.

#### Creating Issues via GitHub CLI
```bash
# List available templates and add to project
gh issue create --repo lightfastai/chat --project 2

# Create with specific template (requires manual body input)
gh issue create --template feature_request.md --repo lightfastai/chat

# Create issue with title and body (recommended approach)
gh issue create --repo lightfastai/chat \
  --title "feat: <feature_description>" \
  --body "Description of the feature"

# Then add to project separately
gh project item-add 2 --owner lightfastai --url https://github.com/lightfastai/chat/issues/<issue_number>

# Or use GitHub web UI which will show template chooser
# Note: Web UI won't automatically add to project
```

**Task Planning & PR Description Management**:
- Use GitHub PR descriptions as the primary task planner and tracker
- Create todo lists for complex features using TodoWrite tool
- Continuously reference and update PR descriptions throughout development
- Link all tasks back to issue acceptance criteria
- Update PR descriptions with progress, blockers, and completion status

### 2. Git Worktree Setup

#### Check Existing Worktrees First (When Resuming Work)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always check if worktree already exists before creating
git worktree list

# If worktree exists for your feature, navigate to it:
cd worktrees/<feature_name>

# If worktree doesn't exist, proceed with setup below
```

#### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the automated setup script for complete worktree initialization
./scripts/setup-worktree.sh <feature_name>

# This script automatically:
# - Ensures main branch is up-to-date
# - Creates worktree at worktrees/<feature_name>
# - Creates branch jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
# - Installs dependencies with bun install
# - Copies .env.local configuration
# - Syncs environment variables to Convex
# - Provides next steps guidance

# Example:
./scripts/setup-worktree.sh add-dark-mode
```

#### Manual Setup (Advanced)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Start with up-to-date main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create worktree for feature development (use subdirectory due to Claude Code path restrictions)
mkdir -p worktrees
git worktree add worktrees/<feature_name> -b jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Change to worktree directory
cd worktrees/<feature_name>

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment configuration
cp ../../.env.local .env.local

# Sync environment variables to Convex
bun run env:sync

# Note: Claude Code can only access child directories of the working directory
# Worktree will be created at: worktrees/<feature_name>/
# New branch is based on current main, so main must be up-to-date
```

### 3. Development Cycle
```bash
# When resuming work, first check if worktree exists
git worktree list

# Navigate to your worktree (if not already there)
cd worktrees/<feature_name>

# Start development servers (choose one option):
# Option 1: Background development (recommended for Claude Code)
bun run dev:bg                        # Runs both servers in background with logging

# Option 2: Concurrent development (foreground)
bun run dev:all

# Option 3: Separate terminals
# Terminal 1: bun run dev              # Next.js development server
# Terminal 2: bun run convex:dev       # Convex backend development server

# Check background servers status
ps aux | grep -E "(next|convex)" | grep -v grep

# View background server logs
tail -f dev.log

# Stop background servers
pkill -f "next dev"
pkill -f "convex dev"

# Make code changes
# ... implement feature ...

# Local validation - MUST pass before commit
# Note: For build without environment variables, use:
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true bun run build
# Or alternatively, pull environment variables:
# vc env pull

bun run lint
bun run format

# Fix any issues found by build/lint
# Repeat until all checks pass
```

### 4. Commit & Push
```bash
# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement <feature_name>

<detailed description>

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
```

### 5. PR Creation & GitHub Project Integration
```bash
# Create PR and automatically add to lightfast-chat project
gh pr create --repo lightfastai/chat --project 2

# Or create PR with specific details
gh pr create --title "feat: <feature_name>" \
  --body "Closes #<issue_number>" \
  --project 2

# Link to original issue
# Include test plan and deployment notes
```

**PR Description as Task Planner**:
- Use PR description as the central task planning and tracking document
- Include todo lists with checkboxes for task progress visualization
- Reference todo list progress and completion status
- Include detailed test plan with acceptance criteria verification
- Document any blockers or issues encountered during development
- Add deployment notes and environment considerations
- Link to related issues and maintain traceability
- Update PR description continuously as development progresses

**GitHub Project Management**:
The repository uses the **lightfast-chat** project (ID: 2) for tracking all development work:
- All new issues and PRs should be automatically added to the project
- Issues start in "Todo" status
- PRs typically move to "In Progress" when created
- Use `--project 2` flag when creating issues/PRs via GitHub CLI

### 6. Deployment Monitoring
```bash
# Check deployment status (requires --yes flag)
vercel ls --yes

# Monitor deployment via GitHub PR status checks
gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup

# Alternative: Monitor deployment logs (if deployment ID known)
vercel logs --follow <deployment_id>

# Get deployment details via GitHub PR
gh pr view <pr_number>

# Note: Vercel CLI requires confirmation for many commands
# GitHub CLI integration provides better PR/deployment monitoring
```

### 7. PR Merge & Cleanup
```bash
# Check PR merge readiness
gh pr view <pr_number> --json state,mergeable,statusCheckRollup

# IMPORTANT: Remove worktree BEFORE attempting to merge
# This prevents "fatal: 'main' is already checked out" errors
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>

# Navigate back to main repository root (if currently in worktree)
cd /path/to/main/repo

# Method 1: Merge via GitHub CLI (preferred)
gh pr merge <pr_number> --squash --delete-branch

# Method 2: If GitHub CLI fails, use web interface
# Visit the PR URL and click "Merge pull request" → "Squash and merge"

# Method 3: Manual git merge (if needed)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --squash jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
git commit -m "feat: your feature description (#<pr_number>)"
git push origin main
git branch -d jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
git push origin --delete jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Verify the merge was successful
git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commits include your feature

# Close related issue if not auto-closed
gh issue close <issue_number> --comment "✅ Completed in PR #<pr_number>"
```

### 8. Post-Merge Cleanup Workflow
```bash
# Complete cleanup checklist:
# 1. ✅ PR merged and remote branch deleted
# 2. ✅ Local worktree removed
# 3. ✅ Local branch cleaned up
# 4. ✅ Main branch updated with git pull origin main
# 5. ✅ Merged changes verified in local main
# 6. ✅ Related issues closed
# 7. ✅ Verify feature is live in production

# CRITICAL: Always sync main branch after merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git status  # Ensure clean working tree with latest changes

# If deployment fails, iterate:
# 1. Check vercel logs for errors
# 2. Fix issues locally
# 3. Run bun run build + bun run lint
# 4. Commit and push
# 5. Monitor new deployment
```

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a real example of the full workflow using issue templates:

### Example: Adding Dark Mode Feature

1. **Create Issue with Template**
   ```bash
   # Via GitHub UI: Click "New Issue" → Select "Feature Request"
   # Fill out template:
   ```
   ```markdown
   ## What needs to be done?
   Add a dark mode toggle to the application that persists user preference

   ## Success looks like
   - [ ] Toggle button in header next to user menu
   - [ ] Theme persists across page refreshes
   - [ ] Smooth transition between themes
   - [ ] All components properly styled for dark mode

   ## Technical hints
   - Start with: @src/app/layout.tsx for theme provider
   - Related to: @src/components/ui components need dark variants
   - Uses: next-themes library (already in @package.json)

   ## Browser testing required
   - [ ] Works on Chrome/Edge/Safari
   - [ ] No console errors
   - [ ] Theme toggle animates smoothly
   ```

2. **Claude Code picks up the issue**
   - Sees @-mentions and navigates directly to layout.tsx
   - Checks package.json to confirm next-themes is available
   - Reviews UI components for theming approach

3. **Create worktree and implement**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-worktree.sh jeevanpillay/add-dark-mode
   cd worktrees/add-dark-mode
   bun run dev:all
   # Implementation happens here...
   ```

4. **Create PR with comprehensive description**
   - Links to issue
   - Updates task list as work progresses
   - Documents any challenges or decisions

This workflow ensures Claude Code has all context needed to implement features efficiently.

## Project Specifics

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15 Canary** with App Router + Partial Prerendering (PPR)
- **Convex** for real-time database & API
- **Biome** for linting/formatting (not ESLint/Prettier)
- **shadcn/ui** components (New York style)
- **Tailwind CSS v4.x**
- **AI SDK** with Claude Sonnet 4 + OpenAI
- **TypeScript** strict mode
- **bun** runtime and package manager (v1.2.10)
- **Turborepo** for optimized monorepo builds

### Code Style (Biome Configuration)
- 2-space indentation, 80-character line width
- Double quotes for JSX and strings
- Arrow parentheses always required
- Non-null assertions allowed in TypeScript
- Import organization enabled
- **IMPORTANT**: Uses Biome, not ESLint/Prettier

### Component Structure
```
src/components/
├── ui/           # shadcn/ui components
├── chat/         # Chat-specific components
└── auth/         # Authentication components
```
- Use TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation consistently
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for component composition

### Project-Specific Features
- **Resumable streams**: Custom implementation for surviving disconnections
- **Feedback system**: v0.dev-inspired thumbs up/down with detailed feedback
- **AI model management**: Multi-provider support with token tracking
- **Thread-based chat**: Complex schema with resumable streaming chunks


## Turborepo Integration

### Performance Benefits
Turborepo brings significant performance improvements to the development workflow:

- **Intelligent Caching**: Only rebuilds what has changed
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs tasks concurrently when possible
- **Remote Caching**: Share build cache across team members (when configured)
- **Incremental Builds**: Dramatically faster subsequent builds
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Automatically optimizes task dependencies

### Turborepo Commands
```bash
# Run all tasks in the pipeline
bun turbo run build lint

# Run with verbose output to see caching in action
bun turbo run build --verbose

# Clear the cache if needed
bun turbo run build --force

# See task dependencies
bun turbo run build --graph
```

### Combined with Bun
The combination of Bun and Turborepo provides:
- **10-20x faster package installations** compared to npm/yarn
- **3-5x faster script execution** for development tasks
- **Near-instant subsequent builds** with Turborepo caching
- **Reduced CI/CD times** through remote caching capabilities

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Use bun (not npm/yarn/pnpm) - v1.2.10
bun install

# Background development (recommended for Claude Code)
bun run dev:bg           # Runs both servers in background with logging to dev.log

# Concurrent development (runs both Next.js and Convex in foreground)
bun run dev:all

# Individual development servers
bun run dev              # Next.js development server
bun run convex:dev       # Convex backend development server

# Complete project setup with instructions
bun run setup
```

### Build & Quality Checks
```bash
# Build for production (required before every commit)
bun run build

# Lint and fix code issues (Biome)
bun run lint

# Format code (Biome)
bun run format

# Build without environment validation (for CI/CD)
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true bun run build

# Run build with Turborepo for maximum performance
bun run turbo:build
```

### Environment Management
```bash
# Sync environment variables to Convex
bun run env:sync

# Verify synced environment variables
bun run env:check

# Deploy Convex functions
bun run convex:deploy

# View Convex logs
bun run logs
```

### Vercel CLI Commands
```bash
# List all deployments (requires confirmation)
vercel ls --yes

# Deploy to preview
vercel --prod=false

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Follow deployment logs in real-time (need deployment ID)
vercel logs --follow <deployment_id>

# Get logs for specific deployment
vercel logs <deployment_id>

# Inspect deployment details
vercel inspect <deployment_url>

# Note: Many vercel commands require --yes flag for confirmation
# GitHub CLI provides better integration for monitoring deployments
```

## Branch Naming Convention

All feature branches must follow the pattern:
```
jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
```

Examples:
- `jeevanpillay/add-dark-mode`
- `jeevanpillay/fix-chat-threading`
- `jeevanpillay/improve-ai-responses`

## Commit Message Format

```

## Quality Gates

### Chat Branching Test Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Always run these test scenarios in the browser before committing any changes to chat branching functionality:

#### Test Scenario 1: Basic Retry Flow
1. User sends: "test"
2. Assistant responds: "It looks like you're testing..."
3. User sends: "test" (again)
4. Assistant responds: "I'm here! If you need help..."
5. **Click retry on first assistant message**
6. **Verify**: New assistant response appears
7. **Verify**: Branch navigation shows (1/2, 2/2) 
8. **Critical**: Only the RETRIED message should show branch navigation, not all messages
9. **Verify**: Switching between branches works correctly
10. **Verify**: No duplicate messages in any branch

#### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Retries
1. Continue from Test Scenario 1
2. **Click retry on the new assistant response**
3. **Verify**: Branch navigation updates to (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
4. **Verify**: Only the retried messages show branch navigation
5. **Verify**: Original messages do not show branch navigation

#### Test Scenario 3: Navigation Between Branches
1. Continue from Test Scenario 2
2. **Navigate to branch 1** using branch selectors
3. **Verify**: Shows first assistant response
4. **Navigate to branch 2** using branch selectors
5. **Verify**: Shows second assistant response
6. **Navigate to branch 3** using branch selectors
7. **Verify**: Shows third assistant response
8. **Critical**: Each branch shows the complete conversation up to that point + the branch-specific response

#### Test Scenario 4: Complex Conversation Branching
1. User: "hello"
2. Assistant: "Hi there!"
3. User: "how are you?"
4. Assistant: "I'm doing well, thanks!"
5. **Retry the second assistant message**
6. **Verify**: Only the "I'm doing well, thanks!" message and its retry show branch navigation
7. **Verify**: "Hi there!" message does NOT show branch navigation
8. **Verify**: User messages do NOT show branch navigation

#### Debug Commands for Testing
```bash
# Open browser console and check for these logs:
# - "🌳 Universal branch navigation:" should only appear for retried messages
# - "🌳 Branch navigation created:" should show correct branch structure
# - No infinite loop errors or "Maximum update depth exceeded"

# Check that branch structure is correct:
# - Main branch should contain original conversation
# - Retry branches should inherit conversation + show new response
```

### Before Every Commit
1. ✅ `bun run build` - Must pass without errors
2. ✅ `bun run lint` - Must pass without errors
3. ✅ Code formatted with `bun run format`
4. ✅ `bun test` - Run automated tests and verify they pass
5. ✅ **Write tests for new features** - Add test files for new functionality using bun test runner
6. ✅ All changes tested locally
7. ✅ **Chat branching tests** - Run ALL test scenarios above and verify they pass

### Before PR Creation
1. ✅ Feature branch pushed to remote
2. ✅ All commits follow message format
3. ✅ Issue linked in PR description
4. ✅ Test plan documented

### Before Merge
1. ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds
2. ✅ No console errors in deployment
3. ✅ Feature works as expected in preview
4. ✅ Issue acceptance criteria met

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
```bash
# Environment variable errors during build
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true bun run build

# Or pull environment variables from Vercel
vc env pull

# Common fixes:
# - TypeScript errors: Fix type issues
# - Import errors: Check file paths
# - Environment variables: Use SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION or vc env pull
```

### Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check deployment status via GitHub PR
gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup

# Check deployment logs (if deployment URL known)
vercel logs --follow <deployment_id>

# Common issues:
# - Environment variables missing in Vercel project settings
# - Build timeout (check vercel.json maxDuration)
# - Runtime errors (check function logs)
```

### Linting Issues (Biome)
```bash
# Auto-fix linting issues (Biome)
bun run lint

# Format code (Biome)
bun run format

# Manual fixes may be needed for:
# - TypeScript type errors
# - Unused variables
# - Import organization (Biome handles automatically)
# - Non-null assertions (allowed in this project)
# - Exhaustive dependencies (disabled for React hooks)

# Note: This project uses Biome, not ESLint/Prettier
# Configuration in biome.json, not .eslintrc or .prettierrc
```

### Worktree Issues
```bash
# Claude Code path restrictions - use subdirectories only
mkdir -p worktrees
git worktree add worktrees/<feature_name> -b jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Branch already exists error
git branch -D jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
git worktree add worktrees/<feature_name> -b jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Cleanup worktree after merge
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>
```

### Vercel CLI Issues
```bash
# Commands require confirmation
vercel ls --yes

# Use GitHub CLI for better integration
gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup
gh pr view <pr_number>  # Shows deployment links
```

### PR Merge & Cleanup Issues
```bash
# "failed to run git: fatal: 'main' is already checked out" error during merge
# MOST COMMON ISSUE: Worktree is still active when trying to merge
# Solution: ALWAYS remove worktree before merging
git worktree list  # Check active worktrees first
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>
cd /path/to/main/repo  # Navigate out of worktree if currently inside
gh pr merge <pr_number> --squash --delete-branch

# Alternative if GitHub CLI fails: Use web interface
# 1. Visit https://github.com/lightfastai/chat/pull/<pr_number>
# 2. Click "Merge pull request" → "Squash and merge"
# 3. Confirm merge and delete branch

# "Cannot delete branch" error
# Solution: Ensure you're not in the worktree directory
pwd  # Check current directory
cd /path/to/main/repo  # Navigate to main repo if needed
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>
git branch -d jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Worktree directory still exists after removal
# Solution: Manually remove directory if needed
rm -rf worktrees/<feature_name>

# GitHub CLI error during merge
# Solution: Fall back to web interface or manual merge
# Method 1: Web interface (recommended)
echo "Visit: https://github.com/lightfastai/chat/pull/<pr_number>"

# Method 2: Manual merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --squash jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
git commit -m "feat: your feature description (#<pr_number>)"
git push origin main
git branch -d jeevanpillay/<feature_name>
git push origin --delete jeevanpillay/<feature_name>

# Check merge status
gh pr view <pr_number> --json state,merged

# Main branch not up to date after merge
# Solution: Always pull after merging
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git log --oneline -5  # Verify your merged commit is present
```

### Main Branch Sync Issues
```bash
# Local main branch missing merged changes
# Solution: Always pull after PR merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Diverged main branch
# Check for local commits that weren't pushed
git status
git log --oneline origin/main..main  # Shows unpushed commits

# If you have local commits, push them first
git push origin main

# Then pull to get merged changes
git pull origin main
```

## GitHub Project Management

```

### Project Status Management
The project uses three main statuses:
- **Todo**: New issues and tasks not yet started
- **In Progress**: Active PRs and issues being worked on
- **Done**: Completed items

### Bulk Operations
To add multiple existing items to the project:
```bash
# Add all open issues
gh issue list --repo lightfastai/chat --state open --json number --jq '.[].number' | \
while read num; do
  gh project item-add 2 --owner lightfastai --url "https://github.com/lightfastai/chat/issues/$num"
done

# Add all open PRs
gh pr list --repo lightfastai/chat --state open --json number --jq '.[].number' | \
while read num; do
  gh project item-add 2 --owner lightfastai --url "https://github.com/lightfastai/chat/pull/$num"
done
```

## Issue Templates

The project includes Claude Code-optimized issue templates designed for efficient AI-assisted development:

### Available Templates
1. **Feature Request** - For new features and enhancements
   - Action-oriented language ("What needs to be done?")
   - Browser-focused success criteria
   - File path hints for navigation
   - Browser testing checklist

2. **Bug Report** - For reporting browser issues
   - Browser-specific reproduction steps
   - Component path hints
   - Console error sections
   - Browser verification checkboxes

3. **Quick Task** - For simple, straightforward tasks
   - Minimal three-field structure
   - Task description, file location, test method
   - No unnecessary boilerplate

### Key Design Principles
- **Browser-only focus**: No OS/environment fields
- **AI-friendly language**: Clear, actionable descriptions
- **Path hints**: Help Claude Code navigate efficiently
- **File references**: Support for @-mentioning files (e.g., @src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx)
- **Minimal friction**: Only essential fields required

### Creating Issues
When creating issues, choose the appropriate template to provide Claude Code with:
- Clear starting points (file paths or @-mentions like @src/app/layout.tsx)
- Specific success criteria
- Browser-testable outcomes
- No irrelevant environment details

#### File References
You can reference files directly in issues using the @ symbol:
- `@src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx` - Reference specific files
- `@convex/messages.ts` - Reference backend files
- `@CLAUDE.md` - Reference documentation

This helps Claude Code quickly navigate to relevant files when working on the issue.

## Development Workflow Specifics

### Dual Server Development
- **Requires two dev servers**: Next.js + Convex backend
- Use `bun run dev:all` for concurrent development or run in separate terminals
- Convex provides real-time database updates and subscriptions
- Environment variables must be synced between Next.js and Convex
- Turborepo optimizes the build pipeline for both servers

### Quality Assurance
- **No testing framework configured** - relies on TypeScript + Biome
- Quality gates: Biome linting, TypeScript strict mode, environment validation
- Build validation prevents deployment with missing environment variables

### Deployment Integration
- Vercel deployment includes automatic Convex deployment
- Custom build command integrates both Next.js and Convex builds
- 30-second function timeout configured in vercel.json

## Environment Variables

Uses `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` for type-safe environment validation:

### Required Variables
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Required for Claude Sonnet 4
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for GPT models
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Convex backend URL

### Optional Variables
- `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` / `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - GitHub OAuth
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `JWKS` - Authentication tokens
- `SITE_URL` - Redirect handling

### Environment Sync
- Custom `./scripts/sync-env.ts` script validates and syncs variables
- Run `bun run env:sync` after environment changes
- Use `bun run env:check` to verify synced variables
- Color-coded output with success/error logging
- Proper handling of multi-line JWT keys and complex values

## Repository Analysis Workflow

### Cloning External Repositories for Analysis

When analyzing external repositories or codebases, use a temporary clone approach:

```bash
# Clone repository into tmp_repo directory for analysis
git clone <repository_url> tmp_repo

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd tmp_repo

# Perform analysis tasks
# - Read files and understand structure
# - Search for patterns and dependencies
# - Analyze code organization
# - Extract insights

# Return to main directory
cd ..

# Clean up after analysis
rm -rf tmp_repo
```

**Important Guidelines**:
- Always clone into `tmp_repo` directory (already in .gitignore)
- Delete the temporary repository after analysis is complete
- Use this approach for:
  - Analyzing external codebases
  - Comparing implementation patterns
  - Extracting best practices
  - Understanding project structures
- Never commit files from tmp_repo to the main repository

### Example Analysis Workflow
```bash
# Clone a repository to analyze its authentication implementation
git clone https://github.com/example/auth-project tmp_repo
cd tmp_repo

# Search for authentication patterns
rg "auth|login|session" --type ts

# Examine specific files
cat src/auth/provider.tsx

# Extract insights and patterns
# ... take notes on implementation ...

# Clean up
cd ..
rm -rf tmp_repo
```

## Notes

- Always work in worktrees for feature development
- Never commit without passing all quality gates
- Use GitHub MCP for issue/PR management
- Monitor deployments actively with Vercel CLI
- Clean up worktrees after features are merged
- Use tmp_repo for temporary repository analysis
