# Getting Started

Get up and running with Lightfast Chat in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun 1.0+** installed
- A **GitHub account** for authentication
- API keys for AI providers (Claude, OpenAI)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightfastai/chat.git
cd chat
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using Bun (recommended):
```bash
bun install
```

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:

```bash
# Convex
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your-convex-url
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your-convex-deploy-key

# AI Providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# GitHub OAuth
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your-github-client-id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

# Site URL
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Set Up Convex

Initialize Convex:
```bash
bun convex dev
```

This will:
- Create a new Convex project (if needed)
- Deploy your Convex functions
- Set up real-time synchronization

### 5. Run the Development Server

In a new terminal:
```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app!
