# Quickstart

Get Lightfast Chat running in under 5 minutes with this quickstart guide.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Bun 1.2.10+** installed ([install here](https://bun.sh))
- A terminal/command prompt
- API keys from at least one AI provider

## 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lightfastai/chat.git
cd chat

# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install
```

## 2. Quick Configuration

Create a minimal environment configuration:

```bash
# Navigate to the main app
cd apps/www

# Create .env.local with your API keys
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
# Convex (local development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210

# AI Providers (add your keys)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-key-here
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-key-here

# Auth (generate a random key)
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=your-random-secret-key
JWKS={}
EOF
```

## 3. Start the Backend

```bash
# From the root directory
bun run convex:dev
```

This will:
- Start Convex development server
- Create database schema
- Deploy serverless functions

## 4. Start the Application

```bash
# In a new terminal, from root directory
bun dev:www

# Or run everything together
bun dev:all
```

## 5. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Quick Customization

### Change the Site Name

Edit `apps/www/src/lib/site-config.ts`:
```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Your Chat App",
  // ... other config
}
```

### Add Your Logo

Replace the logo file:
```bash
cp your-logo.svg apps/www/public/logo.svg
```

### Customize Colors

Edit `apps/www/src/app/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary: 220 90% 56%;  /* Change primary color */
}
```

## Development Tips

### Hot Reload
Changes to your code automatically reload the browser. Try editing:
- `apps/www/src/app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `apps/www/src/components/chat/chat-interface.tsx` - Chat UI

### View Logs
```bash
# Convex function logs
bun run convex logs

# Application logs
# Check your terminal running bun dev:www
```

### Reset Database
```bash
# Clear all data (development only)
bun run convex run --no-push setup:clearAll
```

## Common Quickstart Issues

### "Convex connection failed"
- Ensure `bun run convex:dev` is running
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is set to `http://127.0.0.1:3210`

### "No AI response"
- Verify your AI API key is correct
- Check you have credits/quota with your AI provider

### "Build errors"
```bash
# Quick fix for most build issues
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true bun run build
```
