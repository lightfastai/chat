# Installation

This guide will help you set up Lightfast Chat for development or deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18+ (recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- **pnpm** 10.11.0+ (our preferred package manager)
- **Git** for version control

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightfastai/chat.git
cd chat
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure your variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your API keys and configuration:

```bash
# Required for AI functionality
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Convex backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url_here

# Optional: Authentication
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_secret
```

### 4. Sync Environment Variables

Sync your environment variables to Convex:

```bash
pnpm env:sync
```

### 5. Start Development Servers

You need to run both the Next.js and Convex development servers:

```bash
# Option 1: Run both servers concurrently (recommended)
pnpm dev:all

# Option 2: Run in background (for headless development)
pnpm dev:bg

# Option 3: Run in separate terminals
# Terminal 1:
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2:
pnpm convex:dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on push to main

### Environment Variables for Production

Make sure to set these variables in your production environment:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
- `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` (if using GitHub auth)
- `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` (if using GitHub auth)

## Verification

To verify your installation is working correctly:

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. Sign in with your configured authentication method
3. Start a new chat conversation
4. Send a message and verify AI responses work

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build failures**: Ensure all environment variables are set correctly. Use `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true pnpm build` to bypass validation during development.

**Convex connection issues**: Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is set and Convex development server is running.

**Authentication problems**: Verify your auth provider configuration and callback URLs.
